<h3 class="subtitle">Notes for Historians at the Movies</h3>

<p><em>Marathon Man</em> was <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074860/">a Paramount Pictures movie
of 1976,</a> produced by Robert Evans and Sidney Beckerman and directed
by John Schlesinger from a script by William Goldman based on his 1974
novel of the same name. It comes from a time in movie history familiar
to Historians at the Movies; it starred Dustin Hoffman, who was in
#HATM-covered <em>All the President’s Men</em> the same year, and Roy
Scheider, who was in #HATM-covered <em>Jaws</em> the previous year. It
garnered Laurence Olivier <a
href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1977">an Oscar nomination
for Actor in a Supporting Role</a>; that award went to Jason Robards for
<em>All the President’s Men.</em> As it happens, <em>All the President’s
Men</em> also pulled in an Oscar for adapted screenplay for William
Goldman—his second; he had won a best original screenplay Oscar for
<em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,</em> which might someday qualify
for #HATM treatment. And I bet a lot of folks will be familiar with
Goldman’s other great success, with the 1973 book and the screenplay for
<em>The Princess Bride</em> (1987); moreover, his World War II epic,
<em>A Bridge Too Far</em> (1977) might also someday belong on the #HATM
list. He was a great talent and <a

had range.</a></p>

<p><span class="newthought">If you want to put the movie in
context,</span> the poster for <em>Marathon Man</em> calls it a
thriller, which it obviously is, and you can think of it as a movie that
belongs in conversation with other 1970s thrillers that pit an ambitious
Hollywood leading man against a shadowy government conspiracy. So you
might think of Robert Redford in <em>Three Days of the Condor</em>
(1975) or Warren Beatty in <em>The Parallax View</em> (1974). I bet
Hoffman was thinking of those, anyway. You might also think of it as
connected to other gritty New York City movies of the same era; it comes
from the same year as <em>Taxi Driver</em> and just after <em>The Taking
of Pelham One Two Three</em> (1974)—the latter of which is, for my
money, the best New York City movie of all time. <em>Marathon Man</em>
came out the year before the blackout and the “Son of Sam” murders. It’s
to some degree in a mythical New York City—this movie is very much
suffused with the <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-10/urban-legend-kitty-genovese-38-people">myth
of Kitty Genovese, which was taken as truth by many New Yorkers at the
time,</a> that nobody responds to a call for help. (Although
<em>Marathon Man</em> does have a twist on that, when the neighborhood
delinquents do respond to Hoffman’s actual telephone call for help, but
let’s not get ahead of ourselves.) But it has to be New York City,
because of the need for history to be present, in the form of
communities of German and Jewish émigrés from Europe.</p>
<p>For me, though, I think it’s most useful to think of this story as a
very personal story for Goldman, and one that’s suffused with trauma,
both individual and social. So yes, as Charlie Pierce already led the
way in pointing out, a lot of you may want a warning that there’s <a
href="https://twitter.com/CharlesPPierce/status/1574789348251373574">A
Scene</a> in this movie. And indeed there’s a lot of content people
might want to be warned about: lethal violence, suicide, torture, plus a
certain amount of thoughtless racism and sexism.</p>
<p>But I think The Scene stands in for much bigger traumas that are
central to the movie, and churning away underneath it. Goldman was <a
href="https://forward.com/schmooze/414370/princess-bride-writer-william-goldman-dead-but-immortal-forever/">a
Jewish writer whose father committed suicide,</a> so it’s not a big
stretch to suppose that when he writes about a Jewish writer whose
father committed suicide, there are some personal stakes. The movie is
also drenched in the generational trauma of Jewish Americans of that
era, and indeed since: the Holocaust.</p>

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
</p>
</div>
<p>All that trauma, both individual and social, is invoked in this film,
and also, importantly I think, unresolved.</p>
<p>Goldman was fascinated and frustrated by history, too; that was how
he got into writing about Butch Cassidy, he was just taken with the
story and also how difficult it was to really know anything about it.
Uncertainty was one of his big themes. You may know his maxim about
Hollywood: “nobody knows anything.” But it’s often misquoted, with the
emphasis on “anything”; the emphasis belongs on “knows”: nobody is
<em>certain</em> of anything; “not one person in the entire motion
picture field <em>knows</em> for a certainty what’s going to work.” He
also thought that nobody really knows any <em>one,</em> either. And
that’s what Goldman understood about history, too. We don’t know much;
we can’t know much. But, as he said about writing <em>Butch
Cassidy</em>: “I did all the research I could bear,” and then started
writing. The script took him four weeks. But he had researched for eight
years. You have to do as much research as you can endure—and then “once
you start writing, go like hell” but, he added, in a phrase that is also
evocative of <em>Marathon Man,</em> “don’t fire till you’re ready.”
Writing history is an act first of endurance, and then violence. But
also, it’s futile; you can do the best job possible with the narrative
and still not make it come out right: “endings, frankly, are a bitch.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>And even if you do get it right, it might not make you feel good
about it. It won’t relieve your suffering; it won’t expunge your
trauma.</p>
<p>The central metaphor of the movie is endurance; as Goldman says, how
much can you bear. That’s what a marathon is about—endurance. The movie
opens with footage of Ethiopian runner Abebe Bikila at the 1964
Olympics, winning the marathon for the second time; in 1960, he had won
running barefoot. He exemplified endurance, and the recurring image of
him in the movie exemplifies endurance as well.</p>
<p>Hoffman’s character, Babe Levy, sets out to master history, to
vindicate his father, to write the narrative that will make everything
write. But, as his (thoroughly obnoxious) mentor warns him, as his
brother warns him, he can’t do that. While history can destroy you—look
what it does to the poor old woman in the diamond district—you can’t
defeat it. You can only learn to endure the pain that the past inflicts
on you.</p>
